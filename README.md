Python Scripts used to model beta-catenin
  
  I modeled beta-catenin by starting with the web server Phyre to produce the alignment files necessary to make a model in Modeller. This can be done manually with modeller but is much harder to get an appropriate match of sequences.

  I have included the alignment files made by Phyre and all of the model production files I used.
  
  I have also included the files that are necessary for SMOG simulations.
  
  Finally, I have included BCat.modX.pdb files with what I believe are good starting models for beta-catenin.
  
  Most scripts require python and modeller
